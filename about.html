   <div class="about">A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is an indoor location for athletics. The word is derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasium". They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centres, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions.</div>
   <div class="about">Gymnasia apparatus like barbells, jumping boards, running paths, tennis-balls, cricket fields, and fencing areas are used for exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health.Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing to skipping rope.</div>
   <div class="about">Gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them.
